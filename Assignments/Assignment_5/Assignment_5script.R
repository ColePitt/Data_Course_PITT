#1.  Load the "iris" data set
#2.  Duplicate the following 3 figures (on next 3 pages) and save them in your Assignment_5 directory as "iris_fig1.png", "iris_fig2.png", "iris_fig3.png", respectively.
#3.  Keep in mind that by default, I make most of my figures with theme_minimal() 
#4.  Read through the different plot types on this website 

#<http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html> 
  
 # and use the info to reproduce the fourth figure below. Save it as "iris_fig4.png"
#This last task requires you to use the internet to solve a tricky R task.  This is the most important skill you can learn in this course!
#  You'll probably have to figure out some functions you've not seen before and reconfigure them to the iris data.
