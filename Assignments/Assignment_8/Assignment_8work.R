# Make a new Rproj and Rscript in your personal Assignment_7 directory and work from there.
# Write a script that:
#  loads the "/Data/mushroom_growth.csv" data set
#  creates several plots exploring relationships between the response and predictors
#  defines at least 2 models that explain the **dependent variable "GrowthRate"**
      # One must be a lm() and 
      # one must be an aov()
#  calculates the mean sq. error of each model
#  selects the best model you tried
#  adds predictions based on new values for the independent variables used in your model
#  plots these predictions alongside the real data
# Upload responses to the following as a numbered plaintext document to Canvas:
#  Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
#  In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships?  If so, do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with this in R
